# smarn
smarn is a local, open-source AI-powered feature for Linux that captures and stores screenshots of your activities every few seconds, allowing users to search for past content using natural language. 

## Intentions
smarn is designed as a Linux-exclusive counterpart to Windows Recall (although this is not the sole identity of this piece of software). 
We want to give Linux users a flavour of convenience without the ominous seasoning of spyware on it.
